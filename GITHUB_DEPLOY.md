git add .
```

### 5. Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: IntelAgent multi-agent AI system"
```

## 📋 Post-Upload Checklist

After pushing to GitHub:

1. ✅ **Verify .env is NOT in repo**
   - Go to your repo on GitHub
   - Search for ".env" - should find nothing
   
2. ✅ **Check .gitignore is working**
   - No `__pycache__` folders
   - No `data/` or `logs/` folders

3. ✅ **Test clone on different machine**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IntelAgent.git
   cd IntelAgent
   # Follow README instructions
   ```

4. ✅ **Add repository to your resume**
   ```
   GitHub: github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IntelAgent
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Never commit these files:
- `.env` - API keys
- `*.log` - May contain sensitive info
- `data/` - User uploaded documents
- Personal API keys or tokens

### If you accidentally commit a key:
1. **Immediately revoke** the API key at OpenAI/Tavily
2. **Generate a new key**
3. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
4. **Never** just delete in a new commit (history still has it!)

---

## 📊 Sample Git Commands

### Update after changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: improved error handling"
git push
```

### Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-agent
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add SQL agent"
git push -u origin feature/new-agent
# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```
